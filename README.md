# Password Generator

This Bash script is a simple password generator that allows you to generate a 16-character password with user-specified character types and save it to a file on your system. It provides a convenient way to create strong and customized passwords for various purposes.

## How to Use

1. Run the script:

3. Based on your preferences, the script generates a password and displays it.

4. You will be asked to enter a filename to save the generated password. The password will be saved to the file you specify.
